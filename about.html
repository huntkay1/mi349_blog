         <p>Hi! I'm Kayla! I'm a junior majoring in Information Science 
            at Michigan State University. A study a lot of tech-related topics in 
            my studies, but in my free time, I love to cook. Trying out new dishes 
            is my favorite, and so far, some of my favorites are: </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>chow mien</li>
                <li>baklava</li>
                <li>pasta arrabbiata</li>
                <li>spring rolls with peanut dipping sauce</li>
            </ul>

         <p>I've learned so many techniques throughout the years and it's so rewarding
            to be able to continusously try out more daunting recipes, using the skills 
            that I have learned. Practice makes perfect and it really is rewarding to sit 
            down and share a delicious meal with the people that I love. I hope you enjoy these
            recipes as much as I do!</p>
