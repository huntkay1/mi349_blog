        <h2> Hi there! </h2>

        
         <p><div id = "me"><img src = "me.jpg" alt = "A picture of me" width = "300" height = "400"><p>This is me!</p></div> I'm Kayla! I'm a junior majoring in Information Science 
            at Michigan State University. A study a lot of tech-related topics in 
            school, but in my free time, I love to cook. Trying out new dishes 
            is my favorite, and so far, some of my top picks are: </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>chow mien</li>
                <li>baklava</li>
                <li>pasta arrabbiata</li>
                <li>spring rolls with peanut dipping sauce</li>
            </ul>

         <p>I've learned so many techniques throughout the years and it's so rewarding
            to be able to continusously try out more daunting recipes, using the skills 
            that I have aquired. Practice makes perfect and it really is the best feeling
            to sit down and share a delicious meal with the people that I love. I hope you 
            enjoy these recipes as much as I do!</p>
